The passages enclosed in brackets are quoted in
the Quadrilogus from the work of Alam but they are
not found in any of the MSS, and several others,
which have been here omitted, are evidently tehen,
with alterations, from Herbert de Bosham.

The Letters of Alan are found in asingle manu·
script belonging to Corpus Christi Collega, Cam·
bridge, [No. 288. of Archbishop Parher's collection]
They are addressed to the Kings of England and
France, to Archbishop Baldwin, and others; and
they treat partly of the plane which were formed
for translating the Martyr's body, and placing it in a
tomb more suitable to his merite. Pits says that in
his time there was a manuscript at Louvain, contain-
ing Letters and Sermone written by Alan. There is
certainly no such volume at present in the library of
that University.

Two Sermone written by Alan are found in a
manuscript belonging to the Bodleian Library,
Oxford, [Bodley, No. 338. fo. 990] but they are the
most dull and uninteresting specimens of that class
of writings, and do not contain the slightest historical
allusion. No apology is due to the render for their
being excluded from this volume.
