X retract.

writings are few in number, consisting oi a Life of
Becket, Letters, and two Sermone.

The Vita Sancti 'lhomae occurs at the beginning
of two or three manuscript collectione of Bechet’s
Letters, and ia here printed from n volume in the
Bodleian Library [937], which seems to lay claim ιο
the greatest antiquity. Itis evident from the tenor of
his brief historical sketch that it was meant ιο form a
preface ιο the Letters ofBechet, which Alan ochwhes-
bury is stated by Herhert de Bosham to have collected
into one body. Alan's slretch has the similar tract,
written by John of Salishury, inserted immediately
aller the preface, in all the MS& but it seems nn·
necessary to retain it here, where the tract even os
Alan himself is given principally that this volume
may be a complete collection of Alan's historical
writings. It has been already included, together
with John of Salisbury's work, in the ample collection
now in course of being published by the editor under
the title, Vita S. Thomae Cautuariensis. At the end
of the life of Alan in the Bodleian MS. is the following
note in a handwriting perhaps as old as the rest ol
the volume, i. e. about the date 1220.
