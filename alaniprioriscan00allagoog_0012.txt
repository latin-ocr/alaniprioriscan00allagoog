Pennana.

Onu knowledge of Alan, whose writings are con·
tained in this slender volume, is extremely scanty
aud unsatisfactory. Though it is tolerably certain
that he never played a distinguished part in the
world, yet it is to be regretted that we know so little
of his history, because he not only was a monh of
Canterbury when the primacy was filled by Arch-
bishop Bechet, but is also one of those who compiled
a history of that illustrious Prelate and Martyr.

If it were not for this particular circumstance, we
should still be sensible of a deficiency in our historical
corrections, if any portion os them, throwing light on
the subjects to which they rel'er, were suffered to
romain any longer in the obscurity to which they
have for so many hundred years been consigned.

As hasbeen just remathad, Alan was a monh of ’
Canterbury when Bechct was murdered. In the
year 1179 he was promoted to be prior of that
ehurch, and in 1186 was transferred to the abbacy
of Tewlresbury. He died in the year lan-2. [See
